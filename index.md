# About Me 
[experience](## Programming Language)\
My name is Dennis, senior computer science student at UCSD. I am really interested in computers, I had my first computer when I was 10, built 2 PCs along the way. 
Therefore, there is no doubt that computer science becomes my major. 

## Education 
Unviersity of California San Diego \
Major: Computer science \
Degree: Undergraduate \
Expected Graduation: 2022 July 



## Hobby 
1. Photography
2. working out
3. Gaming 
4. Read Novels

Photography is my favorite activity, I enjoy pressing the shutter to capture that moment. When I look back at those photos, it reminds me of my past. However, I only know how to shoot with cameras, not with smartphones. 

My favorite book is Albert Camus's _Stranger_. It explains _Absurdism_ with a story which I believe it is a great idea. 

```
That was unthinkable, he said; all men believe in God, even those who reject Him. Of this he was absolutely sure; if ever he came to doubt it, his life would lose all meaning. “Do you wish,” he asked indignantly, “my life to have no meaning?” Really I couldn’t see how my wishes came into it, and I told him as much.
```

## Programming Language 
- Python
- Java
- C++ 
- C 


## Programming Experience 
Most of my applications are coded in Java. From my perspective, Java is the most easy to use becuase its documentation is the best. 

Python is is my favorite language to code with, it is sleek, grammerly relieved , and filled with libraries to work with. \
I often use to try different algorithms.\
here is the longest I have ever coded.

`sortDict = {k : v for k , v in sorted( self._backend.countyDayCount().items(), key = lambda item : item[1][0], reverse = True)} `
